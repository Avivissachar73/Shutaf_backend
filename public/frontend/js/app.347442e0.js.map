canvasService = new CanvasService(board, canvasOptions, renderShapeCb, listeners);\r\n\r\ncanvasService.updateCells(shapes, optional findIndexCb) // use to add new shapes / update an existed ones\r\ncanvasService.removeCell(shapeFindIndexOrCb);           // use to remove shape \r\ncanvasService.updateBoard(newBoard);                    // use to upfate the given board\r\n\r\n\r\ncanvasService.removeWindowEventListeners(); // after removing canvas element / destroy\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample for canvasOptions param (the only required one is the selector):\r\n```java script\r\nconst canvasOptions = { \r\n    selector: 'body', // required!\r\n    context: null,\r\n    bgc: 'white',\r\n    enableZoom: false,\r\n    enableScrollUi: false,\r\n
