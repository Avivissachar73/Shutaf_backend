canvasService = new CanvasService(board, canvasOptions, renderShapeCb, listeners);\r\n\r\ncanvasService.updateCells(shapes, optional findIndexCb) // use to add new shapes / update an existed ones\r\ncanvasService.removeCell(shapeFindIndexOrCb);           // use to remove shape \r\ncanvasService.updateBoard(newBoard);                    // use to upfate the given board\r\n\r\n\r\ncanvasService.removeWindowEventListeners(); // after removing canvas element / destroy\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample for canvasOptions param (the only required one is the selector):\r\n```java script\r\nconst canvasOptions = { \r\n    selector: 'body', // required!\r\n    context: null,\r\n    bgc: 'white',\r\n    enableZoom: false,\r\n    enableScrollUi: false,\r\n    enableZoomUi: false,\r\n    enableFlipUi: false,\r\n    enableMirrorUi: false,\r\n    initZoomLevel: 1,\r\n    initRootRenderPos: { x: 0, y: 0 },\r\n    loadImgCb: null,\r\n    enableAnimation:

sent to the service:\r\n```java script\r\nconst matrixBoard = [\r\n     ['*', '*', '*'],\r\n     ['*', '*', '*'],\r\n     ['*', '*', RenderOpts],\r\n ];\r\n\r\n const nonMatrixBoard = {  //

[RenderOpts]\r\n };\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample for shape render opts:\r\n\r\n<br /> Enumerator: One of opts | example: Enumerator('north', 'west') means you can put 'north'/'west' as the value of the
